## NERD FAQ MOMMENT
- Can I be banned?
>  Let me tell you a 😭 touching story ✍😖.......... poor Base64 Junior had a very bad computer 🖱⌨ that always crashed! One sad day while opening 😭 "Vall rant" a part of his HDD got corrupted, and by chance, it also corrupted the "Vall rant" folder..... "VonGuide" thought that poor Base64 Junior was trying 😢 to invade "hate games studios", so they banned him................... days later he came back😍 because it was impossible to differentiate whether he was a monster who replaced a video file or a poor 😞 boy who had problems ☹ with his computer... 💾

- Oooh my gud what's this Base64? I'm scared!
> It's like Mario64, but older

- How does that technique using Base64 code work? (nobody asked)
> Ooooh, thank youu!!! for!! asking!!! anyway, creating other files using the batch script itself is a bit sad, but it's possible to invoke other Windows tools to help so I thought "hmmm why not store the code of the second batch script in Base64? and use PowerShell to decode it? pointing the output to the desired location of the file.bat?"
